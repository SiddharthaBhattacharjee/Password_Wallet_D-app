# Password_Wallet_D-app
This is a password wallet, it stores your passwords securely in the blockchain🔒 which can only be accessed by loading in with your Metamask wallet🔐 So, your Metamask key is the only key you need to unlock any login page🔑<br>

## WARNING : 
This project is just a abstract concept and is made purely for practicing D-app development, It is not made for practical use.<br>
The data stored in blockchain is publically visible even if it is public, hence it is not recomended to store your important passwords in this app.
